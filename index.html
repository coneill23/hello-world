    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p> I am drawn to corners of the web that invite us to slow down, notice, and rethink what we usually pass over. The projects gathered here involve a careful unpacking of a familiar image in Lenna, to listening closely with Bird Sounds, to letterforms shaped by landscapes in National Park Typeface, all treat the web as a living, relational space rather than a neutral container. They make visible the entanglements between technology, land, bodies, and care.<br>

      My own approach to critical web design is shaped by eco-crip and critical plant studies, which ask how systems are built, who they serve, and what kinds of life they quietly exclude or support. I'm interested in web experiences that feel more like gardens than dashboards: accessible, multisensory, imperfect, and attentive to interdependence. These sites model ways the web can cultivate curiosity, accountability, and gentler forms of engagement, such as making room for non-linear thinking, environmental awareness, and more generous ways of being online.<br>

<h2> My Work: Green Statements</h2>
<h3>
<a href="http://missconceptions.net/greenStatements/index.html" style="color:#45374f;">Green Statements</a>
</h3>
<p>Green Statements is an interactive web-based artwork that critiques the rhetoric of corporate environmentalism. The site presents an infinite scroll of sustainability statements sourced from corporate communications worldwide, interwoven with fabricated quotes generated from linguistic fragments found during research. Authentic statements are attributed to their corporate authors, while the fabricated ones are signed “Your Company Name Here,” inviting users to reflect on authorship, responsibility, and truth in public discourse. By remixing the language of greenwashing, the project exposes the performative nature of environmental branding and invites visitors to discern between genuine ecological accountability and rhetorical manipulation. The open-source archive of “usable” statements extends the project's critique into participatory space, transforming language itself into a material for public reflection on sustainability, ethics, and communication.</p>
