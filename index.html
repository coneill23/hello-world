    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p> I am drawn to corners of the web that invite us to slow down, notice, and rethink what we usually pass over. The projects gathered here involve a careful unpacking of a familiar image in Lenna, to listening closely with Bird Sounds, to letterforms shaped by landscapes in National Park Typeface, all treat the web as a living, relational space rather than a neutral container. They make visible the entanglements between technology, land, bodies, and care.<br>

      My own approach to critical web design is shaped by eco-crip and critical plant studies, which ask how systems are built, who they serve, and what kinds of life they quietly exclude or support. I'm interested in web experiences that feel more like gardens than dashboards: accessible, multisensory, imperfect, and attentive to interdependence. These sites model ways the web can cultivate curiosity, accountability, and gentler forms of engagement, such as making room for non-linear thinking, environmental awareness, and more generous ways of being online.<br>
